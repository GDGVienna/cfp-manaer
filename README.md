# Call for Papers Manager

This application allows for simplified management of call for papers,
usable at conferences like DevFest Vienna, Women Techmakers or droidcon Vienna.

## Use Cases

An Administrator can define a conference and open a call for papers.

An Administrator can define the review team for a conference.

An interested Speaker can submit a proposal together with a short
abstract.

A Reviewer can look at a proposal and give it
stars (0-5). This review will be done without taking gender or the
personality of the Speaker into consideration.

A Reviewer can vote on an interested Speaker, based
on experience from previous conferences.

An Administrator can create a report of the existing votings to proposals.

## Application Design

The CfP Manager uses App Engine, Cloud Endpoints, and Data Store.
